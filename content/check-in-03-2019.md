It's been a bit of a quiet month so far. Outside of work I've been really ramping up the frequency and intensity of my workouts at gym, and it feels really great to already be seeing some results. Cooking and preparing meals is now a regular thing too.

Been making some calls around to save on bills

* Car Insurance $110.22 to $78.36: I saved about $30 a month by switching from RACV to Budget Direct. Honestly, the catalyst behind this was the fact that RACV wouldn't help me pursue the at-fault party for an accident, so I thought Why pay them more?
* Mobile Plan $30 to $14.66: Was able to halve by mobile plan expense by switching from Amaysim to Lebara during their Chinese New Year sale. The savings might even be better since Amaysim charges per 28 days.
* Not really a savings but I've finally claimed my bond back from a tenancy I had two years ago. Its funny there was $600 just waiting for me that I'd forgotten About
* Cashed in some cheques I had lying around from 2017. So that was another free $300 was just sitting there

# Highlights #
* Someone reversed into my car at the market last week. I thought they were going to run off, but eventually they got back to me and have agreed to pay for the repair job. Repair is happening in early March
* Mum's 60th birthday! So I made a mistake a wished Mum a happy birthday one day early.. does that make be a bad son? Took the family to Korean BBQ, it was the first time for my parents and I am very glad they enjoyed it.
* Valentine's day is a day I'm spending with myself this year. But that's okay, I'm getting better at accepting and improving the single-version of me, and I think that's cool


# Stats #
Okay trying something new here. My life in numbers,

* **Fitness** - 8 workouts so far this month. Definitely feeling the strength develop
* **Health** - 65% doses taken. Refill management and food diary are still problems I need to work on
* **Mood** - Most days are Good days! 4 Meh days and 1 bad day. For most of last week I was overcome with depression, but my friends were able to pull me out of it.
* **Finance** - On track to save 25%, we'll see how the rest of the month goes
* **Social** - 2 games of D&D but not much else. Otherwise, people are starting to get busier and busier.

Continuing to aim to keep sharpening the expenses. Not too happy with the weight loss at the moment, I'm just having too many cheat meals. BUT, the strength and stamina is going up and up and I am definitely please with that.
