Lately I've been getting interested in Quantified Self, Self Hosting, and Privacy.

Quantified Self in a nutshell is using tools and techniques to record data on anything you want to measure about yourself. You can use this to monitor your weight, heartrate, mood, productivity, and so much more. At the moment I'm using a [Fitbit](//fitbit.com), [Daylio](//daylio.webflow.io/), and [Exist.io](//exist.io) to do this.

With self hosting, there is a movement in tech where people are advocating alternatives to popular online services which they can be self-hosted without giving up privacy or control. For example, using Nextcloud instead of Dropbox, or Wordpress instead of Facebook etc. [awesome-selfhosted](//github.com/Kickball/awesome-selfhosted) and [/r/selfhosted](reddit.com/r/selfhosted/) are great places to find these options.

I also came across [privacytools.io](//privacytools.io), which really pushed me to take my privacy seriously. It's a one-page site with explanations of why privacy is important, and a directory of useful software tweaks and alternatives. What really struck me was this quote,

> Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.

# Highlights #
* **2019!** It's a new year! I hope it turns out to be a good one
* **Back at the gym** New year new me! Last year started off great getting down to 71kg, but I ended the year at 86kg. Consistency is a real problem but I just have to keep working at it.
* **Rebuilt the site.** I just finished rebuilding [victoryn.com.au](//victoryn.com.au), and moving the [blog](//blog.victoryn.com.au) from Wordpress to [Pelican](//blog.getpelican.com/). I've been fascinated with static site generators and trying to achieve lightning fast websites.
* **Selfhosting.** I've rolled a VM again, and loaded it up with some software to replace services I had been subscribing to. Starting with [feeds](//feeds.victoryn.com.au) and [bookmarks](//bookmarks.victoryn.com.au)

Eventually I'm planning to add monthly goals, stats things like that. Aiming to have those in the next check in!
