My work and social situation has been getting the best of my mental.
Am trying to make an effort to see friends more often and get out of this rut.


# Highlights #
* Gaming alot, clocked Sleeping Dogs and onto the DLC


# Stats #
Okay trying something new here. My life in numbers,

* **Fitness** - 0/2 workouts, I have to try harder
* **Health** - 70% doses taken, slightly better but not good enough
* **Mood** - it's been Bad days, struggling to turn it around
* **Finance** - Net worth +2.3%, but cash position needs more discipline
* **Social** - Caught up with James, Janice and Grant. Nice not to feel invisible.

I'm hoping this month will get better
