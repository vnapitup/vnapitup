I've been sick for a few weeks and missed the last check in post.
To be honest I've fallen off the health and fitness habit track, and its something I need to get back on top of.

Lately I've been pushing myself to stay on top of work while fighting this abnormally long cold - I hope I can get better soon!


# Highlights #
* The couple who hit my car have agreed to pay for the repair, and I dropped the car off at the workshop on Friday
* Work has been ramping up hard! I've been frantically working on two RFPs
* Speaking of work, I'm in NZ to kick off an ecommerce upgrade project!


# Stats #
Okay trying something new here. My life in numbers,

* **Fitness** on pause while sick
* **Health** on pause while sick
* **Mood** I fell behind on tracking this, and need to rebuild the habit
* **Finance** went a bit crazy on the spending this period, need to reel it in
* **Social** Here in Auckland, I've been able to get dinner with Heather, and Amy & Siaki! I'm grateful I had the chance to catch up with these guys, always a pleasure and lots of laughs =D
