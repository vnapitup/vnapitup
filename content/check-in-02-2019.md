I love this time of year where people are free to catch up and hang out. It's nice to see everyone before we all get swept up in work and the everyday. But it has been a quiet month at the office so far. The wait has been getting tedious, and I'm hoping to ramp up to some new and exciting projects soon.

I came across an app called [Medisafe](//medisafeapp.com) which is easy to use and gives me dosage and refill reminders. It's a simple, but my favourite feature is the "Snooze until home". Getting home late and forgetting to take a dose here or there can really add up to trouble, this app could be a real lifesaver!

Medisafe, Daylio, and Smiling Mind, are doing wonders for my mental and medical health. I cannot recommend them enough!

# Highlights #
* So many catch ups! Already two birthday parties in, and even more dinners and coffee hangouts
* Ramping up at the gym. DOMS was rough as usual but recovery times are getting quicker and should be able to get into serious growth mode someone
* [Glass](//www.imdb.com/title/tt6823368/). Saw this for Evan's birthday, I hadn't seen the previous two films but I really enjoyed it. In fact, I'll go watch them right now
* [Dragon Ball Super: Broly](//www.imdb.com/title/tt7961060/). I did plan to skip this one after feeling meh about the previous two. But I'm so glad Daniel chose this to watch for his birthday! This is my favourite Dragon Ball movie since Garlic Jnr!


# Stats #
Okay trying something new here. My life in numbers,

* **Fitness** - 5 workouts at the gym, definitely room to grow here. Walking 1km each way to work is heaps better than driving in everyday
* **Health** - 78% doses taken, I need to get better at managing my refills, but not recording my food consumption very regularly
* **Mood** - Most days are Good days! 7 Great days, 2 Meh days. I feel Meh when I'm sick or stuck home.
* **Finance** - Saved around 22% this month. Good, but could be better
* **Social** - 17 hangouts with friends xD
