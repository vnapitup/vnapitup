We all need our own personal space. Whether for self-expression and creativity, or to retreat into sanctuary away from the busyness of the world.

I share a house with three other people. I do this mostly because I want to save up to buy my own apartment or unit, and I can achieve that goal much faster than renting a place on my own.

It is wonderful to be able to share a house with other people, you are never alone, and never lonely. But it can be a problem to never be alone. There are times when you get home after a taxing day and all you want to do is scream. But you can’t, lest you want to reveal that side of yourself to your housemates. So it can be very frustrating not to have that space at home. What can you do?

Life is tough on all of us. It is so very easy to wear out from the immersion of the tasks of jobs, and the other everyday day activities and tasks that make up our lives.

Recently I noticed I was getting not only mentally fatigued but even physically. In fact, it wasn’t so much as the noise in the world that was getting to me, but noise inside my head. Constantly trying to be two or three steps ahead, looking for the next challenge, and planning to plan.

I needed a break. A retreat to somewhere away, where I could be swallowed up by quietness and stillness and let the chaos within me fade away.

So I drove. I booked myself a night stay at a wellness retreat resort out in a country town far far away from home. I drove through the morning peak hour traffic, past all the red lights and railway crossing, and before I realised it, I was driving through the green green pastures and surrounded by trees as far as I could see. I got to that country spa and I disconnected from the world, and myself.

It was daunting. It was quiet. And it was still.

My mind was empty, my soul was at ease.

It was a wonderful experience and since then I’ve felt completely recharged, and back to tackling the day to day head-on. But I know I need to do more to find my sanctuary.

PS. Now I realise I probably should have called this “Retreat” or something like that. Eh, this is what I get for writing from a stream of consciousness.
