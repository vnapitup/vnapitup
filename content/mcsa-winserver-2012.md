**“I challenge myself to earn my MCSA for Windows Server 2012 by July 1st”**

In March last year Microsoft launched the [90 Days to MCSA](//borntolearn.mslearn.net/mcsa90/) Challenge through the [BornToLearn Blog](//borntolearn.mslearn.net/mcsa90/). TrainSignal (now acquired by PluralSight) joined in and [provided](//blog.pluralsight.com/90-days) courses for would-be Solutions Architects to get studying and achieve their MCSA certifications.
It’s not quite the exact same goal as the one set by BornToLearn since I’ve given myself just shy of five months to achieve this, but it’s still going to be a trying journey nonetheless. Usually going about self-study would an immense challenge without some guidance, but fortunately I have a membership with PluralSight to get me on my way.
