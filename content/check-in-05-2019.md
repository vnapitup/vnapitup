I well and truly fell off the writing habit for a while now.
And in that time I stopped being accountable to myself, and I let things pile up.

To be frank it's been a struggle these past few months. But I'm trying to turn it around, and I hope this marks that point.


# Highlights #
* My car was broken into last month, and my backpack (and glasses) were stolen. That cost $600+ to repair


# Stats #
Okay trying something new here. My life in numbers,

* **Fitness** - haven't been to the gym in months now. Aiming to get at least two workouts in before next check in
* **Health** - 54% doses taken, an improvement on the trend recently
* **Mood** - it's been mostly Meh and Bad days, mental health has been a real challenge
* **Finance** -
* **Social** - It's been quiet lately

I'm hoping this month will get better
